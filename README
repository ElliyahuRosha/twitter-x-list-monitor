# Tweet Grabber – Multi-List Puppeteer System

## What this project does
A production-grade Node.js + Puppeteer system that:
- logs into X (Twitter) using stored cookies
- scans curated lists
- detects new tweets deterministically
- captures pixel-accurate screenshots
- stores state safely on disk
- sends results to Telegram

## Why this exists
Explain the real problem you solved:
- X has no stable API for this use-case
- scraping must be robust, deterministic, resumable
- screenshots must be exact, not “best effort”

## Architecture (High Level)
- single Chromium instance
- sequential list processing
- per-list state isolation
- global shared browser resources

## Key Design Principles
- single browser, many logical feeds
- idempotent DB writes
- crash-safe restarts
- zero guessing on tweet identity

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Puppeteer
- Telegram Bot API
- Linux (headless)

No scraping of private content. Educational / portfolio project.
